# spots_game.py

# ICS 32A Fall 2019
# Code Example
#
# This module implements the "view" for our Spots game.  The job of a
# view is to focus on how the game looks and feels -- how it's drawn and
# how the user interacts with it -- while ignoring the details about the
# game's mechanics.  It's not uncommon for the view to hold a reference
# back to the model, which we're doing here.  As the user does things,
# they'll generate events in the view, which will then be sent to the
# model as higher-level operations that affect the game's mechanics.
#
# Note, too, that we've taken a keener eye toward the design of this
# example, by doing a couple of additional things:
#
# * We implemented our game in a class, rather than in a function.  This
#   gives us a natural way to break it up into many functions, while
#   still preserving their ability to share the important information
#   between them (in the form of the "self" parameter that they all
#   share).
#
# * We broke up our game loop into calls to methods in this class.  This
#   took what would have been a long, complex method and made it much
#   shorter.  By giving names to these "helper" methods, we've made
#   clearer the pattern that shows up in our design.  Going forward,
#   if we were to add new features, they would have a place where they
#   belong.  For example, new user inputs would be dealt with in
#   _handle_events; changes to how things are drawn would be dealt with
#   in _redraw; and so on.
