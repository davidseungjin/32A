#
# This module implements the "model" for our Spots game.  The job of a
# model is to encompass the details of how the game works, without
# regard to specifically what it looks like or specifically how the
# user will interact with it.  The overall "world" in our Spots game
# was a collection of spots that could be created and would move in
# random directions on their own.  We're implementing that concept
# here with two classes:
#
# * Spot, which encapsulates the idea of a single spot.  Each spot
#   knows what its center point, radius, and velocity is, where the
#   velocity is tracked as a "delta" (rate of change) in both the
#   x- and y-coordinates.
#
# * SpotsState, which encapsulates the entire state of the Spots
#   game.  Fundamentally, the state of our game is a list of the
#   spots that are currently displayed.  Additionally, SpotsState
#   can do things: add new spots or remove existing spots when
#   clicks happen, move all spots when we change from one frame
#   of animation to the next.

        # with an equal change of any particular value being returned.
        # By multiplying it by 0.01 and subtracting 0.005, we're changing
        # the range of possible results from -0.005 to 0.005 instead.

        # and speed.

        # like English; that's no accident.
        #
        # The reason we're looping through the spots backward is because
        # we want to eliminate the most-recently-added match first, so

        # top.
